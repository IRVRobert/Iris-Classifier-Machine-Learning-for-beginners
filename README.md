# Iris-Classifier-Machine-Learning-for-beginners

#Additional Explanations:

#  Loading and Preprocessing Data: The code uses datasets.load_iris() to load the Iris dataset, which is a standard dataset in machine learning.
#  Feature Scaling: We use StandardScaler to normalize the data, an important step in many machine learning models.
#  Training the Model: We use KNeighborsClassifier, a simple classification algorithm based on nearest neighbors.
#  Evaluating the Model: We measure the model's accuracy using the test set.
